Tagging v1.2

* Massive update from devel
* New interfaces on pygeo.segyread (see below)
* Several new submodules (some more in branches/devel)
* Large number of new utility codes

pygeo.segyread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated to include Cython automatic compilation; falls back to non-Cython version in the case of failed compilation or if Cython is not present
  -- In the future this will be useful for implementing things like IBM -> IEEE conversion in parallel C

- Now uses __getitem__ interface for managing SEGYFile data; iterable and sliceable

- Far superior memory handling via use of SEGYTraceHeader class that loads headers on the fly (i.e., no more eating up 20 GB of RAM when loading a big file)

- Improvements to handling of memory-mapped I/O and fallback I/O (should be automatic)
  -- Untested, but this should work on Windows even though the memory-mapping interface is different (using fallback I/O)

Added several submodules
------------------------

pygeo.coord: Useful functions for coordinate transformations
pygeo.testing: Useful functions for resolution/parameter testing
pygeo.dipfilt: Code from testing conducted about a year ago; dip filtering algorithms implemented in Cython.  May or may not be useful.

Some other submodules in branches/devel, but these are not stable.
